ID5080: Complex Networks <br>
Assignment 1 <br><br>

1. Prove that any connected network with n nodes and (n-1) edges is a tree. <br><br>
2. A simple network consists of n nodes in a single component. What is the maximum possible number of edges it could have? What is the minimum possible number of edges it could have? Explain briefly how you arrive at your answers. 
<br><br>
3. Consider the following two networks: 
<br><br>
Network(a) is directed. Network (b) is undirected but bipartite. Writedown: <br>
a. The adjacency matrix of network(a); <br>
b. The incidence matrix of network (b); <br>
c. The projection matrix for the projection of network (b) onto its black nodes and plot the one mode projection onto black nodes. <br><br>
4. Let A be the adjacency matrix of an undirected network and 1 be the column vector whose elements are all 1. In terms of these quantities write expressions for: <br>
a. The vector k whose elements are the degrees ki of the nodes. <br>
b. The number m of edges in the network. <br>
c. The matrix N whose element Nij is equal to the number of common neighbors of nodes i and j. <br> 
d. The total number of triangles in the network, where a triangle means three nodes, each connected by edges to both of the others. <br><br>
6. Consider a bipartite network, with its two types of nodes, and suppose that there are n1 nodes of type 1 and n2 nodes of type 2. Show that the mean degrees c1 and c2 of the two types are related by
c2 = (n2/n1)*c1
