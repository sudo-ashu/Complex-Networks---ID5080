Assignment no. 2

Can be done in groups of 2 or solo.
Think of a novel measure for exploratory analysis of networks or network
nodes/edges. Show its advantage(s) or limitation(s) mathematically/theoretically or
through an application (you may write the code and demonstrate its application on a
real-world or simulated dataset). Write a brief Wikipedia-like page explaining the
measure you come up with to a general reader.
Hint: the measure you come up with can be a simple tweak of an existing measure.
